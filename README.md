## Machine learning

You have all the pip requirements in the requirements.txt file.
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Must have

- [python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip3
- [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) *If you are using windows powershell it might not work unless you run it with CMD*
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) *We recommend you to install it with pip3* (install tensorflow-gpu if you have cuda on your machine)

### Nice to have

- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads?hl=en)
- [floydhub-cli](https://github.com/floydhub/floyd-cli)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
- [cuda 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive) *Only if your computer can manage it*
- [cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) *Only if you managed to install cuda on your system*

### Workshop

- [ ] Being smarter than AI
- [ ] Train your models in the cloud

## IoT

### Must have

- Electronics (basic level)
  - Some hardware will be provided. We'll give some workshops about some of them but definitely we won't teach you how to light a LED
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- Mobile development. One of
  - [Android](https://developer.android.com) + [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?)
  - [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/) + [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

*Note*: Desktop apps **may** be accepted in some cases. If this is your case talk with the captain of the challenge before any coding!

### Nice to have

- You're free to bring your own hardware :)
- You may want to add some backend to your projects. In this case [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) will be much appreciated
