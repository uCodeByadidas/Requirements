### Minimum

- Electronics (basic level)
  - Some hardware will be provided. We'll give some workshops about some of them but definitely we won't teach you how to light a LED

  - [Android](https://developer.android.com) + [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?)
  - [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/) + [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

*Note*: Desktop apps **may** be accepted in some cases. If this is your case talk with the captain of the challenge before any coding!

### Recommended 

- You're free to bring your own hardware :)
- You may want to add some backend to your projects. In this case [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) will be much appreciated
